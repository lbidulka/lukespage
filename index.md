<!-- ## Luke Bidulka -->

Welcome to my corner of the internet!

I'm an ECE MASc student under [Dr. Jane Z Wang](https://bmiai.ubc.ca/people/jane-z-wang) at UBC currently working on combining Deep Learning and signal processing for automatic diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease. My BASc in Electrical Engineering was completed with distinction at UBC in 2022.

I like thinking about AI, robotics and a whole other list of things too long to mention explicitly.

I've also worked on ML for particle physics at [TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca/research-program/research-topics/DSQC), developing neutrino event classification algorithms for the under-construction [Hyper-K experiment](https://www.hyperk.org/) in Japan.

I'll fill this page out soon<sup>tm</sup> &emsp; ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

###### Header 6

| head1        | head two          | three |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |
| ok           | good `oreos`      | hmm   |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
